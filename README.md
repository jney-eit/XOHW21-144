FPGA Accelerator for Early Detection of Atrial Fibrillation

This repository contains the source files of a project submitted to Xilinx Open Hardware Design Competition 2021.

The presented results are part of the BMBF project "Energy-efficient AI-Systems" which was performed in collaboration with the Fraunhofer ITWM (Jens Kr√ºger, Dominik Loroch, Nico Weber) that substantially contributed to the topology search.  

We propose and demonstrate a low-power and low-cost FPGA-based IP that implements a DNN-based algorithm for early detection of Atrial Fibrillation that is suited for wearable devices.
